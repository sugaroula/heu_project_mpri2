These problems arise in areas like sensor placement, document summarization, and influence maximization.\n",

        "IOHexperimenter provides access to several submodular problems, such as MaxCoverage and MaxInfluence. These problems are typically defined over binary vectors, where each bit represents the inclusion or exclusion of an element in a set. The submodular property means that adding an element to an existing solution can contribute at most as much as adding this element to any subset of the existing solution.\n",

        "- Max Coverage: Given a graph G with weights on the nodes, select a number of nodes with total weight less than a constraint value such that the size of the set of their neighbors is maximal\n",
        "- Max Influence: Given a graph G, select a subset of nodes to maximize the expected number of nodes influenced through a probabilistic spreading process based on the edge weights.\n",
