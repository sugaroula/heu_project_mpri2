# Solving  Optimization problems with Search Heuristics

This is the final project required by the HEU class of MPRI M2. We implemented a new algorithm for solving black-box optimization problems. This repository includes the final algorithm (CatherinotSotiriou.py) but also all intermediate steps taken to produce the result (intermediate algorithms, plots, ect).
